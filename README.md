# Weather Information API

## Overview

The **Weather Information API** provides real-time weather details for a given location (pin code) and date. This API allows users to retrieve weather data such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed for a specific date and location.

The data is fetched based on the **pin code** of the location and the **date** for which weather information is requested. It returns a detailed weather report with attributes like sunrise and sunset times, weather conditions, and various metrics related to the weather.

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/weather`

Fetches weather details for a given **pin code** and **date**.

#### Request Parameters

- `pinCode` (required): The pin code of the location for which weather information is requested.
- `forDate` (required): The date for which the weather data is required, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

#### Example Request

```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/weather?pinCode=721151&forDate=2024-11-09
```

#### Example Response

The API will respond with a detailed weather report in JSON format. Below is an example response:

- A valid service for fetching weather information (integration with external APIs for real-time data).

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-info-api.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd weather-info-api
    ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
